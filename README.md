# Blockchain-Workshop
This repository contains brief descriptions of the topics covered in the workshop and the projects in which I developed smart contracts during an intensive blockchain workshop. The workshop covered a wide range of topics and provided hands-on experience with some of the most critical aspects of blockchain development.

# Topics:
- Dapps (Decentralized Applications): Exploring the architecture and potential of Dapps to revolutionize various industries by providing more secure and transparent solutions. Dapps operate on decentralized networks, making them resilient to single points of failure and censorship.

- Web3: A version of the web with the internetâ€”decentralized, user-centric, and empowering individuals with greater control over their data and digital identities. Web3 technologies aim to create a more open and transparent web, where users are not mere consumers but active participants and owners of their online activities.

- Ethereum & Solidity: Hands-on coding sessions in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Wrote, tested, deployed smart contracts, and explored the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which executes the contract code.

- Smart Contracts: How the self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code are reshaping agreements and transactions. Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, ensuring trust and efficiency in various use cases such as finance, real estate, and supply chain management.

- [Metamask](https://metamask.io): Managing Ethereum wallets and interacting with Dapps. Metamask acts as a bridge between web browsers and the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to securely store and manage their private keys and seamlessly interact with decentralized applications.

- Gas Fees: Understanding the costs associated with executing transactions on the Ethereum network and how to optimize for efficiency. Gas fees incentivize miners to include transactions in the blockchain, and understanding how to manage these fees is crucial for developers and users to minimize costs.

- Tokens: Covering from Fungible to Semi-Fungible to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Fungible Tokens are identical and interchangeable, somewhat like cryptocurrencies. Semi-Fungible Tokens have a hybrid nature, and NFTs are unique digital assets representing ownership of a specific item or piece of content. Applications include gaming, digital art, and beyond.

- Creating and Selling NFTs: Understanding how to create, mint, and sell unique digital assets. Explored platforms like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) for listing and trading NFTs and learned about the importance of metadata, provenance, and royalties in the NFT ecosystem.

- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) & [Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia): Exploring tools and resources to enhance blockchain development and testing. Hugging Face offers powerful machine learning tools, while Sepolia Faucet provides test Ether for developers to experiment with smart contracts without incurring real costs.

- [Remix Ethereum Org](https://remix.ethereum.org/): This hands-on session involved creating, compiling, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts using Remix, a powerful web-based IDE for Solidity development. It allows for quick prototyping and debugging, making it an essential tool for developers.
  
# Projects:
1. Math.sol
  A smart contract focused on mathematical functions and illustrating the concept of inheritance in Solidity.

2. Exchange.sol
  This contract demonstrates sending and receiving Ether with security measures to prevent re-entrancy attacks.

# Getting Started:
To get started with these projects, clone the repository and use Remix Ethereum Org to compile and deploy the contracts by uploading them in the contracts section.
